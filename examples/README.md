## Exemples how to use quick-deploy in different libraries

This is under development, we will keep adding more examples and expanding the tool to cover most common uses cases and provide flexibility to extend to more uncommon ones.


### Roadmap of the supported deployments

- [x]  ~~bart transformers pytorch~~  
- [ ]  gpt transformers pytorch  
- [ ]  t5 transformers pytorch  
- [ ]  custom bert transformer pytorch implementation  
- [x]  ~~timms model~~  
- [x]  ~~custom resnet model pytorch~~  
- [ ]  YoloV4 model  
- [ ]  bert transformers tensorflow
